Structuring the AI's Interaction with the Terminal and User
Your goal is to have the AI interact with both the user and the terminal seamlessly, being aware of when to switch contexts. Here's how you can structure this:

Option A: Dual Modes with Context Awareness
User Interaction Mode: The AI converses with the user, providing responses to user inputs.
Terminal Interaction Mode: The AI interacts with the terminal to perform data management tasks.
Implementation Details:

Mode Switching: Implement a mechanism for the AI to switch between modes, such as:

Commands or Keywords: The AI can detect specific commands or keywords in the conversation that indicate a switch to terminal interaction (e.g., "Let me check the logs" could trigger terminal mode).
Explicit Signals: Use explicit signals or tokens in the conversation to switch modes (e.g., [TERMINAL_MODE] and [USER_MODE]).
Maintaining Context: The AI needs to maintain context about which mode it's in:

Use a variable or state machine within your AI's logic to track the current mode.
The AI should process inputs differently based on the mode.
Interaction Flow:

In User Mode:

The AI receives user input.
Processes the input and generates a response to the user.
Decides whether to switch to terminal mode based on the input or internal reasoning.
In Terminal Mode:

The AI sends commands to the terminal.
Processes the terminal's output.
Decides when to switch back to user mode, possibly after completing a task or upon encountering a prompt.
Example Flow:

User: "Can you check the status of the system?"
AI (User Mode): "Sure, I'll check the system status."
AI switches to Terminal Mode.
AI (Terminal Mode): Sends status command to the terminal.
Terminal: Returns system status information.
AI (Terminal Mode): Processes the output.
AI switches back to User Mode.
AI (User Mode): "The system is running normally with no issues."
Option B: Integrated Conversation with Embedded Commands
Alternatively, the AI can handle terminal interactions within the conversation naturally, without explicit mode switching.

Embedded Commands: The AI decides to perform terminal operations as part of the conversation flow.

Implementation Details:

AI Logic: The AI's reasoning includes deciding when to interact with the terminal based on the conversation.
Terminal Interaction: When the AI needs to perform an action, it sends commands to the terminal, processes the output, and incorporates the results into its response to the user.
Example Flow:

User: "Store this note: Remember to update the project plan."

AI:

Recognizes the instruction to store a note.
Sends store_block command with the note to the terminal.
Terminal confirms storage.
AI responds to the user: "I've stored your note."
