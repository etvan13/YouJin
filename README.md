# YouJin(^-^)

YouJin utilizes **Llama** as the backend NLP integrated with a frontend chat interface. The coordinate system serves as a mechanism for the Bot to navigate and access data stored through a custom terminal interface. Additional features will be implemented in future updates to improve the Agent and terminal's functionality, allowing for more dynamic interactions, namely, the inclusion of an enhanced web scraper, making use of the Grover's search algorithm, and the implementation of Game theoretic algorithms to handle multiple user interactions.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: The interface/GUI for interacting with the Bot.
- **Backend**: Powered by Llama as the NLP, handling AI processing and responses.
- **Terminal**: Uses a coordinate system to manage data storage/retrieval and encryption of chats.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project on your local machine, follow the instructions below.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etvan13/YouJin.git
cd YouJin
```

### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

To ensure all dependencies are installed in an isolated environment, set up a Python virtual environment:

#### a. Create the Virtual Environment:

- On **Windows**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

#### b. Activate the Virtual Environment:

- On **Windows**:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Project

The project runs in two parts: the frontend (user interface) and the backend (API server). Follow the instructions below to run both.

#### a. Start the Backend (Flask API):

1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Run the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. Select an AI method:
    * After starting the backend, the terminal will prompt you to select the AI method to use.
        * **LM Studio**: If selected, ensure that the LM Studio server is running (Open LM studio and run a server for the ai on port 8080).
        * **Local Model**: If selected, ensure you have a local model set up in the local_ai/ directory with the adjusted run_model.py file.
        * **User Input**: This option allows manual input via the terminal (useful for debugging or fallback).
    The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000 and handle AI logic, processing messages sent from the frontend.

This will start the backend server on http://localhost:5000. It will handle the AI logic and process the messages sent from the frontend.


#### b. Start the Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

In a new terminal, do the following:

1. Navigate to the frontend/ directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Start the frontend server using Python's built-in HTTP server:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

This will serve the frontend on http://localhost:8000.


### 5. Access the Chat Interface

Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/
```

From here, you can interact with the chatbot via the user interface.

* When you send a message from the frontend, it will be sent to the backend (running on http://localhost:5000).
* The backend processes the message and responds, and the frontend updates the chat interface with the response.

### 6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment (When Done)

When you're done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Future Development

* Backend Expansion: Future updates will include integration with Llama as the NLP, enhancement of web scraping capabilities with Grover's search algorithm, and possible implementation of Game Theory to handle interactions with multiple users.
* Terminal Interface: The terminal will be enhanced with additional commands, enabling more efficient data navigation through the coordinate system.
